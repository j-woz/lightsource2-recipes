Install conda package conda-build

== Test procedure

* Use `./conda-build.sh` to build the Conda package.
** This always does `conda build purge-all`, which is necessary
* Use `conda-install.sh` to install the Conda package
** This installs the deps separately

== Anaconda tips

Input files:

* meta.yaml
** Used by `conda build` to find metadata and dependencies
* build.sh
** Executed by `conda build` to compile C code, etc.

== What happens

. conda build
.. Conda creates a temporary environment
.. Installs your packages from meta.yaml
.. Runs your build.sh script in that environment
.. Bundles the environment
. conda install
.. Unpacks the bundle
.. String renaming for libraries and scripts
.. Copies everything into the conda space

== Supported platforms

These are standard directory names:

* linux-64: Works
* osx-64: WIP
* osx-arm64: TODO

== Maintainer workflow

== To create a new platform

* Copy the platform-specific directory
* Run the conda-build script and debug it
